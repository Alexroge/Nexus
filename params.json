{"name":"Nexus","tagline":"Nexus \\o/","body":"Nexus\r\n=====\r\n\r\nDSH105's IRC bot. A versatile Java IRC bot using the PircBotX library.\r\n\r\nAccording to Latin (`C17`), Nexus can be defined as `a binding together` (from `nectere` - `to bind`). Therefore, Nexus is the bot that brings everyone together.\r\n\r\nI like contributions ;D\r\n\r\nCurrent Features\r\n================\r\n\r\nWe're very early in development, but we have the features below in place:\r\n\r\n* Modular commands system\r\n* Built-in help system\r\n  * Users can PM the bot for info on all commands or to request extended information on a command.\r\n* A few useful commands offering the following functionality:\r\n  * A reminder command to ping a user (or yourself) after a set amount of time with a customisable message.\r\n  * Currency converter\r\n  * GitHub user/repo info retrieval\r\n  * IP geolocation with google maps support\r\n  * Channel statistics\r\n  * Jenkins build info\r\n    * Currently hardcoded to our CI server. We hope to make this configurable.\r\n  * Temperature converter\r\n  * Dogecoin/USD currency converter\r\n  * Bukkit user profile info\r\n  * Weather lookup command\r\n  * 7 day weather forecast\r\n  * Actions\r\n    * Punch\r\n    * Slap\r\n    * Whip\r\n    * And more..\r\n  * Time command\r\n* Some unit testing! We're still working on expanding coverage but the basics are in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Builds\r\n==================\r\n\r\nYou can grab the latest builds from our [Jenkins instance](http://ci.hawkfalcon.com/view/DSH105/job/Nexus/).\r\n\r\n![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/repositories/DSH105/Nexus.svg)\r\n\r\nJavaDoc\r\n=======\r\n\r\nJavaDocs are available on the [Jenkins instance](http://ci.hawkfalcon.com/view/DSH105/job/Nexus/javadoc/).\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nSee [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing guidelines.\r\n\r\nYou don't really need to worry about that though. The only thing I really want you to follow on that document is the PR formatting. \r\n\r\nWe'll happily work with you on any PRs to ensure they can be pulled ASAP. :smile:\r\n\r\n### Adding a new command\r\n\r\nThe most common contributions will be in the form of adding a new command. This is a relatively painless procedure. The general steps for doing so are outlined below:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repository and clone your fork\r\n2. Navigate to the ``com.dsh105.nexus.command.module package`` in your IDE (in the ``src/main/java/com/dsh105/nexus/command/module/`` directory)\r\n3. Choose the right category for your command, if not create one\r\n4. Create a new class that extends the ``com.dsh105.nexus.command.CommandModule`` class\r\n5. Add the [@Command](https://github.com/DSH105/Nexus/blob/master/src/main/java/com/dsh105/nexus/command/Command.java) (``com.dsh105.nexus.command.Command``) annotation to your class and implement the interface\r\n6. Implement the **onCommand** method\r\n  - In general returning true signifies a valid command (i.e. args were valid)\r\n  - Returning false will result in a help message on command usage\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at the [channel stats command](https://github.com/DSH105/Nexus/blob/master/src/main/java/com/dsh105/nexus/command/module/general/ChannelStatsCommand.java) to give you a head-start.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nWe use Maven 3 to build Nexus. Simply run the `mvn` command in the project root to compile the code and run the unit tests. You'll get a complete JAR in the target/ directory with the dependencies appropriately shaded for you.\r\n\r\nTodo List\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* Allow disabling of certain commands per channel\r\n* Custom command prefix for each channel\r\n* More hooking into GitHub\r\n  * Currently per-user authentication with GitHub is implemented (see `ghkey` command). Maybe there's a nicer way to do this instead of having to post Nexus the link?\r\n* Plenty more commands\r\n* Travis integration ([Click for more information](http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/))\r\n* See #41 for a list of possible new commands","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
